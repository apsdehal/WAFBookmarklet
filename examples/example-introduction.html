    Introduction to Wikidata Web Annotator: To start using it highlight a text fragment, select 'Annotate text fragment' and then create a triple based on the info highlighted. When you are done with creating triples, you can push these annotations to WikiData just by using your regular Wikimedia Software. Click on 'Push to Wikidata', this will open a new screen with your annotations (Remember to push your notebook of annotations in Pundit must be public). Now select the annotations you want to push and click on 'Push to Wikidata' button (obviously after login). The status icon will show you whats the status currently for the pushing of the annotations.
